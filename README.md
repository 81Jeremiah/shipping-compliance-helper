**Welcome to Shipping Compliance Helper**

As someone who has worked in supply chian for 10 years I got tired of searching through routing guides, keeping spreadsheets and just downright being confused with which company requires what. This app is meant to do two things, be a place to group all of the various requirements together and create a community where others can communicate what they've learned to help each other avoid the dreaded chargeback.
